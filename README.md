# Udacity Project Logs Analysis

In this project I created a reporting tool that prints out reports (in plain text) based on the data in the database. 
This reporting tool is a Python program using the `psycopg2` module to connect to the database.
It will answer three questions with database queries:

1. What are the most popular three articles of all time?
2. Who are the most popular article authors of all time?
3. On which days did more than 1% of requests lead to errors?

## Setup

- Make sure you have python and git installed.
- Clone the master fork from https://github.com/josejimenezjr0/logsanalysis.git
- follow the Udacity instructions to [prepare the software and data](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd004/parts/8d3e23e1-9ab6-47eb-b4f3-d5dc7ef27bf0/modules/bc51d967-cb21-46f4-90ea-caf73439dc59/lessons/5475ecd6-cfdb-4418-85a2-f2583074c08d/concepts/14c72fe3-e3fe-4959-9c4b-467cf5b7c3a0)

## How to run

- From your computer in a terminal execute the following code within the directory where you cloned the repository

```
python logsanalysis.py

```

The questions and results should display!
